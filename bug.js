This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been properly initialized or assigned a value. This can happen when using asynchronous operations or when the component renders before data has been fetched.  For example, consider this scenario:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null //Initially null
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    //Error: this.state.data might be null here if the API call hasn't finished.
    return <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text>;
  }
}
```
In this case, `this.state.data` might still be `null` while the component initially renders, leading to a runtime error when trying to access the `.name` property. This is because `setState` is asynchronous, and the data might not be available immediately after the `fetch` call.
